# FinalYearCode
This is a Repo for Francis Yusto Eseko (ESKFRA001) for the project codes implemented to develop my Final Year Project at University of Cape Town

The web application is very lightweight due to dependence of Firebase as a BaaS. Therefore the 2 HTML and the 2 Javascript Files are enough.

The intro page is called frontpage.html - Even if you try accessing ind.html, it'll not work unless the JS code is edited.
